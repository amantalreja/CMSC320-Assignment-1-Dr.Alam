shopping and behavior patterns

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines branches by creating a merge commit,
preserving the full history with a non-linear structure,
which is useful for collaboration but can clutter the commit log.
Rebasing, on the other hand, moves commits from one branch on top
of another, rewriting the history to create a clean, linear commit
log. While merging keeps the development history intact, rebasing
results in a tidier history but should be avoided on shared branches
 to prevent confusion.


Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: During this course, I hope to improve my skills in data wrangling,
specifically in cleaning and organizing large datasets, as well
as enhancing my ability to apply machine learning algorithms to
solve real-world problems. Additionally, I aim to gain a deeper
understanding of data visualization techniques to better communicate
insights from data
